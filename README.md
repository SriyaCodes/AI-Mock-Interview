# AI-Mock-Interview
This is a simple implementation of a mock interview web application built using ReactJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and the Groq API. The platform simulates real interview experiences by generating questions, evaluating user responses, and providing immediate feedback along with correct solutions.

Getting Started
To use the platform, clone the repository and run the frontend and backend servers. You will be guided through an interactive interview session where you can attempt questions and receive real-time feedback powered by the Groq API.

How It Works
The goal of this platform is to help users practice coding and behavioral interview questions effectively:

Question Generation: The Groq API is used to dynamically generate interview questions.

Answer Evaluation: User responses are sent to the backend, where they are analyzed for correctness and feedback is returned.

Past Attempts: Users can view their previous attempts with complete solutions and feedback for revision.

Clean UI: The app is designed to be minimal and user-friendly, offering a focused interview environment.

Secure Data Handling: User data and session history are securely stored using MongoDB.
